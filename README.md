Simple Emacs Profile Manager (sepm) is a simple command that turns
~/.emacs.d into a symlink and lets you manage easily which folder
(called "profile") is the symlink pointing to. You have basic
functionnality like duplicating the current profile and switching
profiles. Nothing fancy.



# Installation

Put the sepm file in your user's or local bin directory and enjoy.
